# Objective of the project
This research seeks to analyze the evolving sentiments and themes in customer reviews of Singapore Airlines to uncover key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction over time. Using advanced techniques such as sentiment analysis, thematic analysis, and time-series forecasting, the study aims to provide actionable insights into how customer preferences have shifted, particularly in response to disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the research examines the alignment of customer feedback with industry benchmarks like the Skytrax evaluation criteria to ensure findings are relevant and impactful. By identifying trends in both positive and negative sentiments, the study aspires to guide Singapore Airlines in refining its service offerings, anticipating future customer needs, and sustaining its industry-leading position. Ultimately, the findings will support evidence-based decision-making, enabling the airline to enhance customer experience, foster loyalty, and remain competitive in the dynamic aviation sector.
